Fault Tolerant is a technical blog focused on creating a space to discuss and open source interesting ideas for anyone to build on. The name borrows the notion of fault tolerance from distributed systems as a metaphor for building resilient ideas as part of a functional idea lab (as coined originally by Tim Urban).
